# Recite

Screen OCR / text grabber (hotkey → drag a region → text on clipboard), using the
Windows/OneOCR engine. C# / .NET 10 WinForms, win-x64, zero NuGet dependencies —
stdlib + Win32/OCR interop only. `AllowUnsafeBlocks` is on for the interop path.
All P/Invoke lives in `Native.cs`.

## Build

```
dotnet publish src/Recite/Recite.csproj -c Release -p:SelfContained=false -o publish/framework-dependent
dotnet publish src/Recite/Recite.csproj -c Release -o publish/self-contained
```

If Recite is running in the tray, the publish output exe may be locked — kill it first.

## Tests

No test framework. `tests/Recite.Tests` is a plain exe with asserts; exit 0 = pass.
Includes a real OCR round trip but stays headless. Production files are pulled in via
explicit `<Compile Include>` in the test csproj — new source files that tests touch
need adding there.

```
dotnet run --project tests/Recite.Tests
```

## Conventions

- Sibling repos (`../blancoshot` = Memento, `../dejavu`) share files by duplication, not
  a shared lib: `AppConfig.cs`, `Native.cs`, `Theme.cs`, `TrayContext.cs`,
  `HotkeyWindow.cs`, `SingleInstance.cs`, `UpdateCheck.cs`, etc. If you fix a bug in one
  of these, check whether the siblings have the same file and port the fix.
- Icons are generated: `python3 tools/make-icons.py` rewrites `assets/` — never hand-edit.
- Runtime config: `%APPDATA%\Recite\config.json`. The Triumvirate launcher
  (`../triumvirate`) reads/writes this file — schema changes must stay compatible.
- CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) recreates a rolling `latest` release on every push;
  scoop manifest in `packaging/scoop/` autoupdates from tags.
